    - If a regular average person were blasted into space with astronauts, would he or she survive?
    - Clayton C. Anderson, US Astronaut, Retired, Written Jul 10, 2014
    - Most certainly they would survive.  This is exactly what the Russians have been doing for quite some time now, in their "Spaceflight Participant" program.  For a substantial fee (upwards of $30 million these days), folks are allowed to fly to the ISS as a "tourist" (probably not the word the Russians prefer).  I trained very briefly with Lance Bass in Star City, Russia, one of the first to venture into this program.  While he did not fly, he helped pave the way for others including South African Mark Shuttleworth and US citizens Dennis Tito and Greg Olsen.  Soon, the United Kingdom's Sarah Brightman will become the next tourist to go.
    - All of these folks receive basic training in Russian systems (how to poop and pee and eat/sleep !), Russian language and emergency operations and survival training.  However, it should be noted that Brightman failed to participate in her recent opportunities for winter and water survival training, making her much more dependent on the abilities of her professional Russian Cosmonaut crew mates and a bigger liability in the event of a serious emergency.  Perhaps she'll pick up those skills somewhere else or at a later date.  The professional astronauts and cosmonauts will ensure the "tourist" survives... it's part of their job and a huge source of pride and responsibility.  I would venture to guess that "all will be well."
    - Akiyama was selected for cosmonaut training in August 1989 in a deal between TBS and the Soviet Union. Akiyama's flight became the first commercially organized spaceflight in history. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyohiro_Akiyama :cite:`Gregersen2009`
