​.. todo:: Death sims usually operate as a roundtable discussion in which one astronaut is announced as having died and whoever is leading the exercise will throw curveballs into the hypothetical scenario that plays out. In his book, Hadfield explains what it was like listening to his own death sim played out: "We've just received word from the Station: Chris is dead." Immediately, people start working the problem. Okay, what are we going to do with his corpse? There are no body bags on Station, so should we shove it in a spacesuit and stick it in a locker? But what about the smell? Should we send it back to Earth on a resupply ship and let it burn up with the rest of the garbage on re-entry? Jettison it during a spacewalk and let it float away into space? The death sims force the astronauts to really think through how they should respond, Hadfield writes: "Who should tell my parents their son is dead? By phone or in person? Where will they even be - at the farm or at the cottage? Do we need two plans, then, depending on where my mom and dad are?" I'm guessing a similar sim might have been done for the Apollo astronauts.

.. todo:: Contingency sim (death sim)
    in a board room (some people can call in on a speaker)
    Starting scenario: Chris on the ISS isn’t feeling well
    Every 5 to 10 minutes, person who runs the experiment tosses green card (new wrinkle)
    Cards are divided among training teams who has to come up with as many realistic scenarios as possible
    (One green card may be: we’ve just received from the station that the astronaut is dead)
    Takes several hours
    How you die
    What will be with your family
    What will be with space program
    Everyone participate (managers, PR, MCC, flight, space program administrator, dead astronaut)
    What will do with his corpse (they don’t have body bags)
    How quickly body will decompose
    How crew mates will deal with the trauma
    Put body in airlock and let it free on EVA?
    Put in the resupply ship to burn in the atmosphere?
    (Green card: it’s just been tweeted that there was a report on ISS and NYtimes reporters are calling
    New problems when still the old ones haven’t been dealt with
    How PR people should respond
    Should NASA or CSA take the lead (Hadfield Simulation)
    When the statement should be issued and what should it say?
    Green card coming faster and faster
    How should tell his parents?
    By phone or in person?
    Where they’ll be at the time?
    Do we need two plans depending where they might be?
    Family members are not required, but welcome
    Who will contact kids if he dies?
    What happen when reporter contacts first?
    How fast a parent can be with kids (if parent is abroad at the time)?
    How time zone differences and reception would influence on contact ability with key decision makers in Huston?
    Proving ground for your plan, but most often it shows flaws in your planning
    Which astronaut to recruit to help family?
    Is your finances and paperwork in order?
    It is because when you start, you have to think only about flying to space, and not to consider anything else
