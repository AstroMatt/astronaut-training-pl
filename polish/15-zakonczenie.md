<!-- TODO: Zakończenie
- Astronauts are overachievers and some astronauts go on to very eclectic things.  One of the most interesting astronauts is Story Musgrave.  He was an active astronaut for over 30 years and holds the distinction of being the only astronaut to fly on all five space shuttles.  While he was an astronaut he obtained 7 graduate degrees – math, computers, chemistry, medicine, physiology, literature, and psychology.  In his spare time he was a trauma surgeon, pilot, and parachutist.  Today he operates a palm farm in Florda, a production company in Australia, and a sculpture company in California.  He is a landscape architect.  He has worked for Disney's Imagineering team as a concept artist.  He teaches design at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena.  And he's a public speaker with 20 honorary doctorates.
