# Praca astronautów na Ziemii

<!-- TODO:

The astronaut's responsibilities on Earth include:
- acting as capcoms
- testing robotic procedures
- developing spacewalk choreography,
- training other astronauts
- educating Canadians about space and motivating young people to study science and technology
- conducting any other tasks required by the CSA or NASA


Participating in research and development activities

Some astronauts help advance space technologies.

For example, Jeremy Hansen underwent intensive helicopter flight training at the Flight Research Laboratory of the NRC of Canada. A former CF-18 pilot with the Royal Canadian Air Force, he was asked to test NRC technologies by simulating a lunar landing!

These flights enabled Jeremy to evaluate the feasibility of using a Bell 205 helicopter as planetary lander simulator. The technology could potentially be commercialized and shared with the private industry and other space agencies.

Learning to survive in extreme conditions

At the end of a mission in orbit, astronauts return to Earth aboard a Soyuz capsule to a designated location in the steppes of Kazakhstan. Ground crews generally manage to extract the crew members within a few minutes of their landing.

However, in the event of a problem or a deviation from the intended trajectory, the astronauts must be prepared to survive in remote or hostile environments (e.g. at sea, in a forest or in a desert), in summer or in winter. In such cases, it might take the ground crew hours or even days to reach them!

This type of training also helps the astronauts build their:

sense of team spirit
decision-making ability
leadership skills
Finally, once an astronaut receives an assignment to a space mission, he or she may begin mission-specific training.
